**** Command Pattern ****
The command pattern encapsulates requests so that the invoker is loosley coupled from the receiver (the class that
actually performs the requests). Usually, you will have a command object, with an execute method, and that command
object will have a reference to a receiver that actually does all the work. This allows the client to simply create
command objects and call execute, and swap them out at will, without ever needing to know about nitty gritty application
code.

**** Textbook Definition ****
In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to
encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
